                <div class="experience-description">
                    During my co-op at Nucor's bar mill in Jewett, I worked on failure analysis and quality
                    improvement initiatives that directly impacted production efficiency and customer satisfaction. I
                    analyzed 22 failed steel heats using scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy
                    to trace inclusion sources back to their origins in the steelmaking process, preventing over
                    $900,000
                    in potential customer claims and informing targeted process improvements. To streamline quality
                    reporting, I developed Python automation tools that transformed a manual 2-hour weekly scrap data
                    processing task into a 20-minute automated workflow, improving data accuracy and freeing up
                    significant time for analytical work. My investigation of tensile test failures involved correlating
                    mechanical property data with upstream processing conditions (analyzing rolling mill strand data,
                    nominal weight distributions, and heat-to-heat variations) to identify root causes and inform
                    production improvements that I presented to supervisors. I performed microstructural analysis to
                    diagnose failure mechanisms, interpreting grain structures, inclusion morphologies, and phase
                    distributions to establish connections between steelmaking practices and material performance
                    issues. I also maintained SEM calibration protocols and performed
                    routine equipment maintenance per ISO quality standards to ensure measurement reliability and
                    laboratory accreditation compliance.

                    Working at the intersection of mining technology and federal policy, I supported the National Mining
                    Association's advocacy efforts on critical minerals and environmental regulations. I analyzed over
                    15 critical minerals patents and pieces of legislation to identify key technical and policy
                    implications for domestic supply chain security, work that directly supported congressional
                    testimony preparation. To quantify the economic impact of proposed EPA environmental regulations on
                    the mining sector, I compiled regulatory compliance cost estimates totaling $2.3 million across 8
                    member company operations. I researched environmental fate and toxicity data for the 6PPD tire
                    additive to assess potential impacts on mining operations and inform the association's regulatory
                    strategy. A significant part of my role involved translating complex technical concepts for
                    non-technical audiences; I created fact sheets that made mining processes and mineral processing
                    technologies accessible to policy makers and congressional staff. I monitored federal rulemaking
                    processes and distilled lengthy stakeholder comments into concise summaries that enabled association
                    leadership to make strategic decisions during public comment periods. I also attended Congressional
                    hearings and provided technical support during regulatory briefings, serving as a resource for
                    mining industry perspectives on emerging environmental and minerals policy issues.

                    My research focused on developing shape memory polymer blends for 3D printing applications, with
                    potential uses in biomedical devices.
                    I optimized thermoplastic polyurethane and polycaprolactone blend compositions to achieve a 10%
                    increase in tensile strength and 99.9% shape recovery rate, properties which make these materials
                    particularly suitable for shape memory applications.
                    Operating twin-screw extruders, I produced consistent filaments by carefully controlling temperature
                    profiles, screw speed, and feed rates to eliminate diameter variations and ensure reliable
                    printability for additive manufacturing. To understand the fundamental behavior of these materials,
                    I characterized their properties using scanning electron microscopy, dynamic mechanical analysis,
                    and X-ray diffraction, verifying thermal transitions, mechanical performance, and crystalline
                    structure critical for shape memory behavior. I developed Python automation workflows to extract
                    mechanical properties from raw tensile test data, reducing processing time and eliminating manual
                    calculation errors. Beyond the lab, I engaged K-12 students through Polymer Pathways
                    Program demonstrations, conducting hands-on activities designed to spark interest in materials
                    science and polymer engineering. This work culminated in a co-authored research paper published in
                    the Journal of Materials Science documenting our development and characterization of these shape
                    memory polymer blends.

                    I spent the summer exploring the potential of magnetically actuated millirobots for minimally
                    invasive medical procedures. I designed these robots using 3D-printed PLA structures with embedded
                    permanent magnets, carefully considering how magnetic field interactions could enable controlled
                    locomotion at the millimeter scale. Through systematic testing of three different locomotion
                    modes (pivot walking, tumbling, and rolling) I determined that pivot walking achieved 40% faster
                    speeds while providing more controlled navigation through complex environments. Fabricating these
                    prototypes using fused deposition modeling required maintaining 0.1mm dimensional tolerances to
                    ensure precise magnet placement and consistent magnetic response for reliable locomotion control. I
                    validated navigation capabilities by guiding the robots through maze environments using
                    electromagnetic coil control systems, demonstrating the feasibility of remotely controlled
                    microrobots for applications like targeted drug delivery. Throughout the summer, I collaborated with
                    graduate students to integrate my experimental findings into the lab's broader medical robotics
                    research program, contributing to their development of next-generation surgical tools.

            <p>I make clothes. I am currently obsessed with tailoring and fitting, having discovered that understanding
                how woven fabrics behave along the bias versus the straight grain is surprisingly relevant to getting
                sleeves to set properly and darts to lie flat.</p>

            <p>I have made a variety of things, like <b>blazers that mostly fit around the shoulders</b>, <b>wrap
                    dresses with questionable closure engineering</b>, and <b>experimental structured pieces</b> that
                looked
                better as technical flats than as actual garments, as well as numerous toiles and fitting muslins that I
                have no pictures of because before 2025, I hadn't yet accepted that documentation might actually help me
                remember why certain adjustments worked.</p>
